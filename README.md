# ESPHome Transit Tracker Component

This is an external component for [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) that fetches and renders a live arrivals board for any transit agency supported by the [Transit Tracker API](https://github.com/tjhorner/transit-tracker-api).

This component is used by the [DIY Transit Countdown Clock](https://github.com/EastsideUrbanism/transit-countdown-clock) project. Check it out if you want to build your own!

## Note

Though this can technically work with any display supported by ESPHome, it is optimized for and tested with a 128x64 LED matrix display.

## Usage

Check out the `examples` directory for a full example configuration.

You can use this component in your ESPHome configuration by importing it with `external_components`:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://tjhorner/esphome-transit-tracker
    components: [transit_tracker]
```

You will need these components in your configuration:

- [Display](https://esphome.io/components/display/)
- [Font](https://esphome.io/components/font/)
- [Time](https://esphome.io/components/time/)

Then you can define an instance of the component like so (note that this is a complete example; most parameters are optional):

```yaml
transit_tracker:
  id: tracker

  # Base URL of the Transit Tracker API
  base_url: "wss://tt.horner.tj/"

  # The feed code of the transit agency you want to track
  feed_code: "st"

  # Maximum number of arrivals to show
  limit: 3

  # Default color for route names
  # (See https://esphome.io/components/display/#color)
  default_route_color: my_favorite_color

  # Whether to display arrival or departure times
  time_display: departure # or "arrival"

  # How to list trips:
  #   sequential: All trips across all routes in order of arrival/departure
  #   nextPerRoute: Each route's next trip in order of arrival/departure
  list_mode: sequential

  # List of stop and route IDs to track
  stops:
    - stop_id: "1_71971"
      # If it takes you a known amount of time to walk to the
      # stop, you can set a time offset here so that the time
      # displayed on the board is more like a "leave by" time
      time_offset: -8min # e.g., if it takes you 8 minutes to walk to the stop
      routes:
        - "1_100113"
        - "1_102704"
    - stop_id: "1_71961"
      time_offset: -10min
      routes:
        - "1_102548"

  # List of custom styles for route names and colors
  styles:
    - route_id: "1_102548"
      name: "B"
      # See https://esphome.io/components/display/#color
      color: rapidride_red

  # List of custom abbreviations for headsigns
  abbreviations:
    - from: "Bellevue Transit Center Crossroads"
      to: "Bellevue TC"
    - from: "Transit Center"
      to: "TC"
```

Then, finally, in your display's draw lambda:

```yaml
display:
  - platform: # ...
    id: # ...
    lambda: |-
      id(tracker).draw_schedule();
```
